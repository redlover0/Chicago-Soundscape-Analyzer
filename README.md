## Smart Audio & Safe Listening in Chicago:

**Visualizes noise, population, and demographics across 77 Chicago communities!**
This project investigates potential correlations between noise levels and community characteristics. This PERN stack web app, built for a Google Code Next project, Builds understanding of urban sound and serves as a foundational step towards my personal vision of building my start-up **SafeSound**

## Overview  

As part of my second term as a Student Engineer @ Google Code Next in the Engineering Practicum cohort by Coach Asim, we were tasked with developing an Interactive Web Application. This term we focused on building **autodidactic learning skills** and mastering our first stack **PERN stack** for web app development.

### Use case:

*   **Analyze Chicago's Soundscape:** Explore noise levels, population, and demographics in 77 communities.
*   **Investigate Auditory Enviorment:** Questions Answered:
    *   Does demographics & population impact noise levels in Chicago?
    *   Is the noise level in my community healthy?
    *   What does a Safe Noise Level look & Soundlike in my community?
*   **Social Good:** Aims to address Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL).
  *Preventing 20% of NIHL could yield $123B+ in economic gain.*
