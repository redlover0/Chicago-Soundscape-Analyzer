## Smart Audio & Safe Listening in Chicago:

**Visualizes noise, population, and demographics across 77 Chicago communities!**
This project investigates potential correlations between noise levels and community characteristics. This PERN stack web app, built for a Google Code Next project, Builds understanding of urban sound and serves as a foundational step towards my personal vision of building my start-up **SafeSound**

## Overview  

As part of my second term as a Student Engineer @ Google Code Next in the Engineering Practicum cohort by Coach Asim, we were tasked with developing an Interactive Web Application. This term we focused on building **autodidactic learning skills** and mastering our first stack **PERN stack** for web app development.

### Use case:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> *   **Analyze Chicago's Soundscape:** Explore noise levels, population, and demographics in 77 communities.
> *   **Investigate Auditory Enviorment:** Questions Answered:
    *   Does demographics & population impact noise levels in Chicago?
    *   Is the noise level in my community healthy?
    *   What does a Safe Noise Level look & Soundlike in my community?
> *   **Social Good:** Aims to address Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL).
  *Preventing 20% of NIHL could yield $123B+ in economic gain.*

## Product Features

When creating this. I was tasked to only create 2 functional requirements. i finished with 5 bringing my web app to the market 2-3 weeks before due date, leaving time to improve and add new features

>[!TIP]
> User can interact with a UI to choose which data analysis or visualization they want to see so they can access the information they need.
> User must be able to view at least 3 data analyses and 2 different visualizations.
> User can read an "About Me" page to learn about the web app's creator.



this is where i explain its features

## Instruction Manual

this is where i show you how to run it

## Wireframes

## User Stories

this is my business thesis

## Data-Journey

this is all the transfermations of the data & data credits
