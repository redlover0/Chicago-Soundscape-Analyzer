# Chicago Soundscape Analyzer: 
visualizes noise, population, and demographics across 77 Chicago communities

This project investigates potential correlations between noise levels and community characteristics. This PERN stack web app, built for a Google Code Next project, Builds understanding of urban sound and serves as a foundational step towards my personal vision of building for 'Smart Audio & Safe Listening'

## Overview  

As part of my second term in the Google Code Next Engineering Practicum, our cohort, guided by Coach Asim, embarked on a mission to develop an Interactive Web Application. This initiative was designed to sharpen our **autodidactic learning skills** and master **PERN stack web development**.

### use case:

*   **Analyze Chicago's Soundscape:** Explore noise levels, population, and demographics in 77 communities.
*   **Investigate Auditory Enviorment:** Questions Answered:
    *   Does demographics & population impact noise levels in Chicago?
    *   Is the noise level in my community healthy?
    *   What does a Safe Noise Level look & Soundlike in my community?
*   **Social Good:** Aims to address Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL).
  *Preventing 20% of NIHL could yield $123B+ in economic gain.*
